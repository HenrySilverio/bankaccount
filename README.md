# Simple Bank Account CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application written in Java that simulates basic banking operations.

## Features

*   Displays client name, account type, and initial balance.
*   Provides a menu with the following options:
    1.  Check Balance
    2.  Transfer funds
    3.  Receive funds (Deposit)
    4.  Exit

## How to Run

1.  Compile the `Main.java` file:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```
2.  Run the compiled class:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the banking menu.

## Code Overview

The application uses a `while` loop to keep the menu active until the user chooses to exit. User input is handled using the `Scanner` class. An `if-else if` block processes the selected menu option.# bankaccount
